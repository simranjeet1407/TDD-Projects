## Setup

1. Clone this respositary to your machine.
2. Go into the project's rrot directory, and run the command `npm install`.
3. Run the test suit using the command `npm test`.

If the command `npm test` does not work, you may need to install mocha globally on your machine.Do this with the command `npm install -g mocha`.

## What we learned working on this Project

- I learned how to use Chai's assertion syntax for unit tests.
- I learned the Node.js and also improved my skills working on Visual Studio Code.
